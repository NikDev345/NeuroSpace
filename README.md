🪐 Hyper-Realistic 3D Planet Card (Three.js + GLSL)

An interactive 3D holographic Earth card, powered by Three.js, GLSL shaders, and post-processing bloom.
It renders a physically-accurate Earth surface, with real day/night transition, cloud layers, specular ocean highlights, and a glowing atmosphere using custom shader logic.

The planet sits on a glass-like holographic card, with smooth mouse-based tilt interaction, breathing animation, scroll zoom, and a galactic starfield background.

Designed for immersive UI exploration, modern Sci-Fi UI, data dashboards, or futuristic digital cards.

No bundlers required — everything runs directly via ES modules.

🧑‍💻 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
cd YOUR-REPO

2. Start a local server (recommended)

Three.js ES modules must run from a local server.

npx serve


or

python -m http.server 8000


Then open:

http://localhost:8000

🌍 How It Works (Short Breakdown)
Earth Rendering

The planet uses one sphere with three textures:

Diffuse map (day)

Night lights map

Specular map

Cloud transparency map

Shader computes:

NdotL = dot(normal, sunDirection);
dayMix = smoothstep(-0.2, 0.2, NdotL);
finalColor = mix(nightSide, daySide, dayMix);


Plus specular ocean, cloud whitening, and dark-side scattering.

Atmosphere

A second slightly larger sphere with:

pow(bias - dot(vNormal, viewDir), power)


gives a soft rim halo.

Starfield

Instead of random box noise, we generate a sphere shell:

const dir = new THREE.Vector3(...).normalize();
const radius = 20 + Math.random() * 20;


So stars form a natural sky dome.
